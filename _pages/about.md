I am interested in Deep Learning and its applications. I have focused on designing and implementing deep neural models on language, vision tasks and game environments. Specifically, I have worked on a diverse set of models and methods that help machines to read, comprehend, and gather information from both static and interactive knowledge sources. I am also interested in finding ways to harvest commonsense and procedural knowledge from language environments and use them to help machines to do reasoning. Other than above, I am interested in deep generative models, specifically methods that helps Natural Language Generation models to generate diverse and sense-making outputs.
